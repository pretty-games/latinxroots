                    Last year, I participated in a game jam called <span class="highlight">Unidos 2024</span> where I had the opportunity to research some of the LatinX legends. I really enjoyed diving into their stories and learning about these incredible historical figures who have shaped our communities and the world.

            <div class="question-section">
                <div class="question">Why did you create this website?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    This year, when the game jam theme "<span class="highlight">roots</span>" was announced, it reminded me of how much I enjoyed researching LatinX legends. While I wasn't going to be able to participate in the game jam this time, the theme felt like another perfect opportunity to explore these stories.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing that bothered me about my previous game jam experience was that all the research I had done ended up being buried within the game itself. This time, I decided to take a different approach with a two-part plan: first, create this comprehensive website with all the information I would normally put into a game, and then, if time allows, develop a simple game that leverages this research.

                    This website serves as a digital repository of <span class="highlight">historical Latin American and Caribbean figures</span> who have made significant contributions to society and their communities. Each profile includes biographical information, their major accomplishments, and the lasting impact they've had on both society and the Latino community.

                    You can explore the collection through our interactive interface, search for specific people or topics, and access all the data through our open API for your own projects.
